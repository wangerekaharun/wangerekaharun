## üöÄ Kotlin Conf '23 Confersations
Excited to have been interviewed by [Huyen Dao](https://twitter.com/queencodemonkey) at Kotlin Confersations ‚Äò23.

Watch the full interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7QNYJiUwE).

## üöÄ [KotlinConf '23 - Transforming Farmer's Lives Using Android in Kenya](https://kotlinconf.com/talks/388978/)

The session covered how we at Apollo Agriculture change the lives of farmers using Android. This is the story of how Apollo Agriculture relies on two Android apps, entirely written in Kotlin, are offline first, and heavily rely on Server Side Driven UI to render the UI components.

I dived deeply into the challenges we face when developing apps for devices with low memory, low internet bandwidth, offline-first approach, and some of the critical lessons we've learned so far. This session shows how our server-side UI approach with Jetpack Compose works, the reasons that made us adapt this, and the implementation details of our stateful approach in building UI Components with Compose. Additionally, the session covers the tools we use to make this possible: an internal tool called "Choice Expressions" and an implementation of JsonSchema, both used to build UIs from a set of conditions.
